## Project Overview

This project involves:
- Cleaning and preprocessing the `used_cars.csv` dataset.
- Conducting exploratory data analysis using visualizations.
- Building predictive models for:
  - **Car Price Prediction** using regression models.
  - **Car Demand Prediction** using classification models.
- Comparing different machine learning models to select the best one.
- Saving the models using `pickle` for future use.

## Dataset Description

The dataset `used_cars.csv` contains information about used cars, including:
- **Price** (target for regression).
- **Demand** (binary target for classification).
- **Attributes**: mileage, brand, model year, transmission type, fuel type, etc.

---

## Libraries Used

The following Python libraries were used:
- **Data Manipulation & Analysis**: `pandas`, `numpy`
- **Visualization**: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- **Machine Learning**: `sklearn`
- **Model Persistence**: `pickle`

---

## Data Preprocessing

Key preprocessing steps:
1. Removed special characters from `price` and `milage`.
2. Dropped rows with missing values in critical columns.
3. Removed duplicates and outliers.
4. Encoded categorical variables.
5. Created new features like `car_age` and `milage_per_year`.
6. Engineered a `demand` feature based on price thresholds.

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis

We visualized key relationships and trends using:
- Scatter plots (e.g., `milage` vs. `price`).
- Box plots for categorical variables:
  - Price vs. Brand
  - Price vs. Fuel Type
  - Price vs. Transmission

## Machine Learning Models

### Regression Models (Price Prediction)
1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Decision Tree Regressor**
3. **Random Forest Regressor**
4. **Gradient Boosting Regressor**

### Classification Models (Demand Prediction)
1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Random Forest Classifier**
3. **Gradient Boosting Classifier**

---

## Model Evaluation

- **Regression Metrics**:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - R-squared (R2)

- **Classification Metrics**:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/car-price-demand-prediction.git
   cd car-price-demand-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python car_price_demand.py
   ```

4. Models are saved as:
   - `price_model.pkl`: Predicts car price.
   - `demand_model.pkl`: Predicts car demand.

---

## Future Work

- **Feature Enhancement**: Include additional variables such as car condition using image analysis.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Experiment with advanced algorithms like neural networks.
- **Real-time Prediction**: Develop an API for model deployment.
